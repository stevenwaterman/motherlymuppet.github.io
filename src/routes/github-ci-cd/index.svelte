    For my latest blog post, I tried something different and created an interactive visualisation.
    I designed it from the ground-up to work with the Scott Logic blog, and it won't work on this site.
    Therefore, you'll have to <a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/02/24/github-cd.html">read it on the Scott Logic blog</a> instead!
