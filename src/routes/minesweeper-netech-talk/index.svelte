  <p>
    I was recently invited to NE:Tech to give a 15-minute talk on solving minesweeper.
    It wasn't what I (nor anyone else) expected, but I'm really happy with how it went.
    In the future, I hope to give some more traditional tech talks, and there's definitely things in the pipeline.
    Keep an eye out!

    The full talk is available via youtube:
