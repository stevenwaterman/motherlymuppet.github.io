    This post is quite delayed, but I only just got ahold of the video!
    Just before Christmas, I gave my first ever tech talk internally at Scott Logic.
    It (attempts to) explain how to solve minesweeper, while solving minesweeper, with a 3 minute time limit.
    If you have seen my <a href="/minesweeper-netech-talk">second talk on minesweeper</a>, you'll probably aleady know everything that I discuss - but I hope it's fun anyway!
  </p>

    The full talk is available via youtube:

    The slides are also <a href="/assets/blog/minesweeper-lightning-talk/how-to-solve-minesweeper-in-3-mins.pdf">available as a PDF</a>.
