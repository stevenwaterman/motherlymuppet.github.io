    I'll introduce three examples, as someone might talk about them.
    Try and decide whether continuing on is the right decision, or whether they're making a bad decision due to the sunk cost fallacy.`,Z=s(),b=i("p"),b.textContent=`At its core, the Sunk Cost Fallacy is about letting your decisions be affected by previous decisions that you can't change.
    Rather than looking back at what you've done previously (and can't change), remove all of that and just look forwards instead.
    After each example, I'll reframe it to remove any information about how we got here, and just look forwards instead.`,g=s(),h=i("p"),h.textContent=`The examples are thought experiments, and in reality there would be a lot of extra options.

    We should ignore those, and only look at the costs and benefits that will happen in the future.
    Dropping out is free, and has no impact on lifetime earnings (in this example).
