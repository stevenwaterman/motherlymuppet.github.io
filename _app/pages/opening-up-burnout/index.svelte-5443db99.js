    In many cases, burnout is related to one&#39;s job.

    In my case, it was the result of repeatedly trying to improve something at work, getting excited and motivated about it, and then having that blow up in my face.

    <p>Reward could be anything.
      The feeling of a job well done, the expectation of career advancement, or soft recognition by peers.
      It&#39;s dependent on the individual and project.
      You could even have an outward success and a pay raise but if you wanted your peers to love you and they didn&#39;t...
      Burnout.</p> 

    <p><strong>The disconnect between effort and reward teaches your brain to associate effort with failure.</strong>
      It&#39;s no surprise that &quot;Take a break&quot; didn&#39;t help you, because I think that doesn&#39;t work in general: it doesn&#39;t reassociate effort with expected reward.</p>
